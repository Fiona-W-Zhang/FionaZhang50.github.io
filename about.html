      <p> I am a high school student from the Bay Area that is interested in art and computer science. 
    For art, ever since I was young I have always had a natural inclination to doodle and draw. Since then I have dedicated many days outside of school time 
    to study new art techniques, styles, and working on my own art pieces. For computer science which may seem like such a complete difference to art, I started 
  learning it later on in life, and since then, I have completed many projects in class and in summer programs such as creating a Blackjack program in Java or a machine
  algorithm with Python.
